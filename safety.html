    <p class="my-2">As we bring people to space, we take the safety of our passengers very seriously. We want our passengers to have an unforgettable and exciting experience, while also ensuring their safety at all times. We ask that our passengers adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Follow the instructions of the crew:</strong> Our crew members are trained professionals who are responsible for the safety of our passengers. Please listen carefully to their instructions and follow them at all times.</li>
    <li><strong>Wear your safety equipment:</strong> We provide all passengers with safety equipment such as helmets, oxygen masks, and seat belts. Please wear your safety equipment properly and keep it on until instructed otherwise.
</li>
      <li><strong>Stay seated during takeoff and landing:</strong> During takeoff and landing, please remain seated and keep your seat belt fastened until the crew gives the all-clear signal.
</li>
      <li><strong>Be aware of emergency procedures:</strong> In the event of an emergency, please follow the instructions of the crew and be prepared to act quickly and calmly. Familiarize yourself with the location of emergency exits and equipment.</li>
      <li><strong>Be aware of your surroundings:</strong> While on board our spacecraft, please be aware of your surroundings and be careful not to bump into equipment or other passengers.</li>
      <li><strong>Be mindful of your health:</strong> Space travel can be physically demanding. Please inform the crew of any medical conditions or concerns you may have prior to your flight. We also recommend that you stay hydrated and get plenty of rest before your flight.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow safety protocols in space:</strong> In space, there are specific safety protocols that must be followed. Please follow the instructions of the crew and be aware of any special safety procedures that apply in space.</li>
      <li><strong>Enjoy the experience:</strong> Space flight is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. While safety is our top priority, we also want you to enjoy your adventure to the fullest. Take the time to savor the views and create memories that will last a lifetime.</li>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Emergency Procedures</h2>
    <p class="my-2">Space can be unpredictable. While we take every precaution to ensure a safe and enjoyable space tourism experience, emergencies can happen. In the event of an emergency, our trained crew members will respond quickly and effectively. We have skilled onboard medical staff during the entire duration of every flight, and we have put together the following guidelines for passengers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Listen to the crew:</strong> In the event of an emergency, please listen carefully to the instructions of the crew. They are trained professionals who are responsible for the safety of our passengers.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay calm</strong> It's important to remain calm in an emergency situation. Panic can make the situation worse and hinder efforts to resolve the problem.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow emergency procedures:</strong> Every spacecraft is equipped with emergency procedures that should be followed in the event of an emergency. Familiarize yourself with the emergency procedures prior to your flight and be prepared to act quickly and calmly.</li>
      <li><strong>Wear your safety equipment:</strong> In an emergency, the crew may instruct you to put on safety equipment such as helmets, oxygen masks, or seat belts. Please wear your safety equipment properly and keep it on until instructed otherwise.</li>
      <li><strong>Be prepared to evacuate:</strong> In the event of an emergency, the crew may instruct you to evacuate the spacecraft. Please follow their instructions and be prepared to leave the spacecraft quickly and safely.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay together:</strong> If you are traveling with others, please stay together and keep track of each other during an emergency.</li>
      <li><strong>Don't interfere with emergency personnel:</strong> In an emergency situation, the crew may be working to resolve the problem. Please do not interfere with emergency personnel or attempt to handle the situation yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow post-emergency procedures:</strong> After an emergency has been resolved, the crew may instruct you to follow certain post-emergency procedures. Please follow their instructions carefully.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Origin passengers will likely never find themselves in an emergency situation, but every flight is equipped with the staff and tools necessary to handle it should one arise. The safety of our passengers is our top priority!</p>
